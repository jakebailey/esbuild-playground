# esbuild-playground

`esbuild-playground` is a "yet another" playground for
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), with a few cool tricks:

- `esbuild` runs as you type. Yes, `esbuild` is that fast; but thank Evan for
  that, not me!
- The _full_ `esbuild` binary is run in-browser via WASI. If it works on disk,
  it works in the playground! (Okay, sorry, no plugins. Yet?)
